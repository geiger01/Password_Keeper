# Password_Keeper
Keeps your passwords so you won't forget them .

This code I made has a GUI from Tkinter that basically lets you register a username, email, and website name and then confirm it so that it is saved in a local json file so that you will not forget your passwords. There is also a function that makes a password for you that includes letters, numbers and symbols if you want a strong password.
You can use the "Search" button to get a popup of your details about a specific website so you won't have to search in the json file itself.
