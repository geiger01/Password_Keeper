# Password_Keeper
Keeps your passwords to different websites in a text file.

This code I made has a GUI from Tkinter that basically lets you register a username, email, and website name and then confirm it so that it is saved in a local text folder so that you will not forget your passwords. There is also a function that makes a password for you that includes letters, numbers and symbols if you want a strong password.
